FLAMES is a simple game popular among young people. It's a compatibility test based on names. Write down two names, cross out matching letters, count the remaining letters, and assign each number a letter from the acronym FLAMES (Friends, Lovers, Affectionate, Marriage, Enemies, Siblings). The final letter reveals the predicted relationship between the two people. It's often played for fun and doesn't hold any real predictive value.
